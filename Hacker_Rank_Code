-- HackerRank Set problem 

/* TASK
You are given a set A and N number of other sets. These N number of sets have to perform some specific mutation operations on set A.

Your task is to execute those operations and print the sum of elements from set .

Input Format

The first line contains the number of elements in set A.
The second line contains the space separated list of elements in set .
The third line contains N integer , the number of other sets.
The next 2*N lines are divided into N parts containing two lines each.
The first line of each part contains the space separated entries of the operation name and the length of the other set.
The second line of each part contains space separated list of elements in the other set.

 0 < len(set(A)) < 1000
 0 < len(otherSets) < 100
 0 < N < 100

Output Format

Output the sum of elements in set A.*/

/* TASK
Mr. Anant Asankhya is the manager at the INFINITE hotel. The hotel has an infinite amount of rooms.

One fine day, a finite number of tourists come to stay at the hotel.
The tourists consist of:
→ A Captain.
→ An unknown group of families consisting of K members per group where K≠1 .

The Captain was given a separate room, and the rest were given one room per group.

Mr. Anant has an unordered list of randomly arranged room entries. The list consists of the room numbers for all of the tourists. The room numbers will appear K times per group except for the Captain's room.

Mr. Anant needs you to help him find the Captain's room number.
The total number of tourists or the total number of groups of families is not known to you.
You only know the value of K and the room number list.

Input Format

The first line consists of an integer, K , the size of each group.
The second line contains the unordered elements of the room number list.


Constraints


Output Format

Output the Captain's room number.
